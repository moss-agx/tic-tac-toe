# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game using python.
This game is very popular amongst all of us, and it's also a lot of fun to code in Python. I'm sure most of us know how to play it, but let me refresh your memory.
A nine-square grid is used in this two-player game. At each chance, each player chooses their move and marks their square one with O or X. The player who makes all of their marks in a straight line, whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins. The other player's challenge is to both block their opponent's game and make their own chain.
The Pygame Python library, which is loaded with all computer graphics and sounds, can be used to build this project in Python.
